# DoS Service Fuzzy Search API

## Introduction

This is the DoS Service Fuzzy Search API.  This is a RESTFUL API which will return a list of services that match the search criteria passed to the API.  The API will perform fuzzy matching on the search criteria specified, and will fuzzy match against the following service attributes:

- service name
- service public name
- service address
- service postcode

The API endpoint is called by passing the search criteria in as query parameters.

The minimum number of characters in the search criteria is set by the PARAM.VALIDATION.MIN_SEARCH_STRING_LENGTH environment variable. The maximum number of search criteria is set by the PARAM.VALIDATION.MAX_SEARCH_CRITERIA environment variable.

## Building the API

The API can be built by running the following command:

    make build

The API has a single GET Rest endpoint:
- /byfuzzysearch

The API will return a list of matching services in JSON format. This is defined on Confluence: https://nhsd-confluence.digital.nhs.uk/display/SFDEV/Known+Service+Search
